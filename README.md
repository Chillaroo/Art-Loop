User Story

As an art and culture enthusiast
I want to access artwork from multiple cultures
So that I can develop a portfolio of my favorites



WHEN I choose a culture from the dropdown
THEN I am presented with an example piece of an artist from  the culture chosen.
WHEN I View the artwork
THEN I will see a short description of the art underneath the piece
WHEN I select another slide on the carousel
THEN I am shown a new piece of artwork
WHEN I choose the "Like" button
THEN the pieces I've liked are saved in local storage and persist on the page
