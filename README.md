The Art-Loop app uses two API calls to different art museums to allow you search for art by category. Choose a category of art from the dropdown menu, and press "View Art" to see several pieces. Just swipe to move from one peice to the next. If you see something you like, click "Like" and the URL will be saved to local storage and appear at the bottom of the screen. You can revisit your collection of liked art by clicking on the URLs. To clear your collection, just press the "Clear" button.
